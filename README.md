# Todo Table

## Overview

The "Todo Table" is a simple React application that allows users to manage and display a list of tasks (todos) in both a list view and a table view. Key features of this application include adding new tasks, marking tasks as completed, and filtering tasks based on completion status. The application uses various React concepts such as `useState`, `useEffect`, and `localStorage` for data persistence.

## Features

## Concepts Demonstrated

- **useState**: Used to manage state variables, such as the todo list and input field value.
- **useEffect**: Employed for handling side effects, like saving and retrieving data from `localStorage`.
- **localStorage**: Utilized to store and retrieve todo data on the client side.
- **Filtering**: Implemented to filter todo tasks based on completion status.
